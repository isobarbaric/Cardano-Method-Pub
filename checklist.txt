changes:

ideas:
- turn into python package? 
- testing with generated data? (not all cubics seem to be working flawlessly atm)
pip install cardano-solver? idk

- variable names
- documentation
- publish

done list
=========
- make round function more friendly by overloading the one in the math module (to make syntax better)
- allow custom setting for number of digits of accuracy for the roots 
ABOVE 2 THINGS GO HAND IN HAND 
- allow for real numbers to more easily operate with complex numbers by     
    1. allowing real numbers to automatically be interpreted as complex numbers 
    OR at least
    2. letting imaginary parameter be optional so that real numbers don't have to be initialized with a zero in the imaginary number's place
- make display of real numbers (basically imaginary coefficient = 0) without the 'i' part 
- main.py doesn't interface properly with other files
- shift part is getting stuck because of future changes to the coefficients list; have commented out relevant part in main.py, hopefully making main.py interface with the rest of the files will make it a lot easier 
- find a better name than "coefficients", its WAY too long
